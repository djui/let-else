The `let?` macro expands into a `let`, except where a binding is followed by `:when` _pred_ or `:else` _else_ or both, in either order.

For a `:when`, the _pred_ is evaluated after the associated binding is evaluated
and must be truthy to continue evaluating the rest of the bindings and the body.
If the _pred_ is falsey, the _else_ is the value of the `let?`, if present, or `nil` if not.

For an `:else` without a `:when`, if the associated binding is falsey, _else_ is the value of the `let?`.

E.g.

```clojure
(let?
  [foo (f1) :when (w) :else (e)
   bar (f2)]
  (b1)
  (b2))
```
expands into

```clojure
(let [foo (f1)]
  (if (w)
    (let [bar (f2)]
      (b1)
      (b2))
    (e)))
```
and

```clojure
(let?
  [foo (f1) :else (e)
   bar (f2)]
  (b1)
  (b2))
```
expands into

```clojure
(let [foo (f1)]
  (if foo
    (let [bar (f2)]
      (b1)
      (b2))
    (e)))
```
